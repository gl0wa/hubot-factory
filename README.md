# Hubot Factory

Hubot Factory. Because Hubot-as-a-Service is awesome.

Janky Factory. Because I can.

## Getting Started

Use bundler to install all of your dependencies.

    bundle install

Now you need to copy the example.env file to .env and replace the config options with your own.

    cp example.env .env

Next edit .env, replacing place holders with your configuration options.

Finally you can start the application by running:

    foreman start
