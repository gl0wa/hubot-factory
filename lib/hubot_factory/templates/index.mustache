  <h2>Heroku Details</h2>

  <h2>About Your Hubot</h2>

  <p>
    Your Hubot will need a name. This is what it will be programmed to listen
    for and respond to.
  </p>

  <p>
    <label for="name">Hubot Name:</label>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Hubot" name="name" />
  </p>

  <p>
    Your Hubot needs to be plugged into an adapter. This is the service it
    will listen and respond on.
